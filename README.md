### Hello there 👋

My name is Jakob, and I am a software engineer living in Trondheim. On my [website](https://jakob.fun) you can find a full overview of my projects and portolio. I have also posted some highlights here:

[📽️ Exploring Features in Modern CSS](https://youtu.be/WQSJpEcnzIE) A talk that I ended up giving at the 5 largest software conferences in Norway in 2024.

[🍷 View Transitions Wine Shop](https://jakob.vin) A vanilla html/js/css demo of the View Transitions API. Created for [a talk](https://vimeo.com/1069766487) held at Booster Conf 2025.

[🥂 Polet+](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/polet+/ebkhfjjpghjiihkfkkihmnipgijmjbpi) Chrome extension that adds Vivino scores to the Norwegian government-run wine retailer's website.

[🎓 emnr.no:](https://emnr.no) Website where university students can rate their courses. Created in collaboration with a fantastic group of people as part of a university project, is now owned and further developed by [Studentmediene](https://studentmediene.no/), a volunteer student organization in Trondheim.

[📺 My YouTube Channel:](http://youtube.com/c/JakobKiellandYT) Contains videos of various quality on a variety of topics (90% of which are unlisted). It does have a few videos I'm pretty proud of though, and since other people seemed to like them too I've included it here, despite not being strictly related to programming 🤓
