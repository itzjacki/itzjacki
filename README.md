### Hello there 👋

My name is Jakob, and I am a computer science student at NTNU Trondheim. I have a pretty, proper portfolio website in the works, but for now this will have to do. Check out some of my my projects here:


[🎓 emnr.no:](https://emnr.no) Website where university students can rate their courses. Created in collaboration with a fantastic group of people as part of a university project.

[🎨 anderslollik.no:](http://anderslollik.no) Portfolio for graphic designer Anders Lollik Andersen

[📷 Kielland foto:](http://itzjacki.com/kfoto) Portfolio for photographer Tore Kielland

[🎮 Afterglow(2017):](http://itzjacki.com/Afterglow) Simple and addictive rhythm game made in Java. I am (kind of) in the process of reworking it from the ground up [here](https://github.com/itzjacki/Afterglow).

[❓ The Red and Black Challenge:](http://redandblackchallenge.com]) A series of 15+ creative challenges that started as a hobby project in 2017. The visuals/code of the site isn't really why I'm displaying this project (as they are very old). The reason I include it here is that it's a project I've had tons of fun with, and I believe it helps display my creativity. If you are interested in checking out the challenges, but don't want to progress through it by solving them, email me.
