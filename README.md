### Hello there 👋

My name is Jakob, and I am a software engineer living in Trondheim. On my [website](https://jakob.fun) you can find a full overview of my projects and portolio. I have also posted some highlights here:

[📽️ Exploring Features in Modern CSS](https://youtu.be/WQSJpEcnzIE) A talk that I ended up giving at the 5 largest software conferences in Norway in 2024.

[🍷 View Transitions Wine Shop](https://jakob.vin) A vanilla html/js/css demo of the View Transitions API. Created for [a talk](https://vimeo.com/1069766487) held at Booster Conf 2025.

[🥂 Polet+](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/polet+/ebkhfjjpghjiihkfkkihmnipgijmjbpi) Chrome extension that adds Vivino scores to the Norwegian government-run wine retailer's website.

[🎓 emnr.no:](https://emnr.no) Website where university students can rate their courses. Created in collaboration with a fantastic group of people as part of a university project, is now owned and further developed by [Studentmediene](https://studentmediene.no/), a volunteer student organization in Trondheim.

[🎮 Afterglow(2017):](https://jakob.fun/Afterglow) Simple and addictive rhythm game made in Java. At one point of my life I was in the process of reworking it from the ground up [here](https://github.com/itzjacki/Afterglow).

[❓ The Red and Black Challenge:](http://redandblackchallenge.com) A series of 15+ creative challenges that started as a hobby project in 2017. The code behind the site definitely isn't why I'm displaying this project (it's some of the first code I ever wrote, and I haven't touched it much since). The reason I include it here is that it's a project I've had tons of fun with, and I believe it helps display my creativity. If you are interested in checking out the challenges, but don't want to progress through it by solving them, [DM me](https://bsky.app/profile/jakob.fun).

[📺 My YouTube Channel:](http://youtube.com/c/JakobKiellandYT) Contains videos of various quality on a variety of topics (90% of which are unlisted). It does have a few videos I'm pretty proud of though, and since other people seemed to like them too I've included it here, despite not being strictly related to programming 🤓
